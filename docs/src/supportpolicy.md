# Support Policy

Although a hobby, I have wanted to test the idea of some sort of support policy for my projects. In my experience, it provides a nice fallback. For example, a bug in the unzipping process when I switched APIs in my former Blue Rose launcher and updater forced me to create an LTS out of a version that lacked the change while I searched for the cause of the problem. With the current development speed of COSMOS, a hypothetical LTS would possibly last one year.
