TOMAS (**To**ny's **Ma**naged Operating **S**ystem) is a modular hobby operating system written in C# using the [COSMOS](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) framework. It comes with a respective terminal emulator using for Core testing.

Both the kernel and terminal emulator will eventually support programs and plugins, respectfully. With the former allowing for running of native .NET executables and the latter Lua plugins, while taking advantage of the existing [interface](./design/interfaces.md) architecture.
