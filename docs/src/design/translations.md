# Translations

Since 23.0, TOMAS uses a derivative of [CST.NET](https://github.com/tonytins/cstdotnet) for handling translations. Naturally, it follows the same [interface](./interfaces.md) paradigm as described in the last chapter with ``IUIText`` being renamed to ``ITranslations``, located in ``Tomas.Interface.Globalization``, but the two remain compatible. Changes made here will eventually make their way back upstream.
